1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var: Declares variables with function or global scope and allows re-declaration and updates within the same scope.
let: Declares variables with block scope, allowing updates but not re-declaration within the same block.
const: Declares block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

map(): Transforms each array element and returns a new array without changing the original.
forEach(): Executes a function on each element but returns nothing (undefined); used for side effects.
filter(): Selects elements that meet a condition and returns a new array; original array stays unchanged.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Arrow functions in ES6 provide a shorter way to write functions using the => symbol. They omit the function keyword, curly braces, and return for simple one-line functions.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring assignment in ES6 lets you unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into variables easily and clearly.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals in ES6 use backticks () to create strings, allowing embedded variables and expressions with ${...}` syntax.
